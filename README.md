Developing a mobile application can easly go wrong if developer do not architect their application carefully. With this example app I want to show one of the modern mobile architectural pattern: The MVVM-C.

# MVVM-C

MVVC-C stands for Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator. The base idea came from the MVVM pattern, it's common on Android Development but less on iOS that still use an MVC approach, other ideas came from Clean Architecture (VIPER) and from the basic principles that should be used in every software: The SOLID principles.
